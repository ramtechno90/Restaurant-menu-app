            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our Restaurant Menu App ("Service"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our Service, which allows you to place food orders with participating restaurants. By using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes. To place an order, you must provide a name for identification purposes. This name does not need to be your legal name, but you are responsible for the information you provide.</p>

            <h2>3. Orders</h2>
            <p>When you place an order through the Service, it constitutes an offer to buy the products from the restaurant. The order is not confirmed until it is accepted by the restaurant. We are not responsible for the preparation, quality, or delivery of the food; our role is to facilitate the order process.</p>

            <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the Service provider. The names, logos, and menus of the restaurants are the property of their respective owners.</p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall our Service, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

            <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.</p>

            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact the restaurant directly. The restaurant owner will then coordinate with the service provider to address your query and provide a response.</p>
