            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our Restaurant Menu App ("Service"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following information from you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> We collect the name you provide to identify your order.</li>
                <li><strong>Order Details:</strong> We collect the details of the food items you order, including quantities and any special instructions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect any other personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or payment details.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of processing your order and communicating it to the restaurant. Your name is used to identify your order for pickup or service.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your order information, including the name you provide, is stored in our database, which is hosted by Supabase. We rely on Supabase's industry-standard security measures to protect your data. We do not share your information with any third parties other than the restaurant you are ordering from.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your order data as required for the restaurant's operational purposes. Completed and rejected orders may be cleared from the system periodically by the restaurant administrator.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>As we only collect your name for a single transaction, we do not create a permanent user account. If you have concerns about your data, please speak directly with the restaurant staff.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the restaurant directly. The restaurant owner will then coordinate with the service provider to address your query and provide a response.</p>
